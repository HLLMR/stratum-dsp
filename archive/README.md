# Archive (construction debris)

This directory contains **archived** code and scripts that are no longer part of the active Stratum DSP pipeline, but were kept for later review.

## Policy

- If something is **truly irrelevant**, it should be deleted instead of archived.
- If something is **potentially useful** (historical reference, future work, or alternative implementation), it may be moved here with a short note explaining why.
- Archived code is **not compiled** as part of the crate and may be incomplete.
